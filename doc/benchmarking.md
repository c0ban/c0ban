Benchmarking
============

c0ban Core has an internal benchmarking framework, with benchmarks
for cryptographic algorithms such as SHA1, SHA256, SHA512 and RIPEMD160. As well as the rolling bloom filter.

After compiling c0ban-core, the benchmarks can be run with:
`src/bench/bench_c0ban`

The output will look similar to:
```
